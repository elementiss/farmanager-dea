## SaveAndRun

SaveAndRun is a Lua script for Far Manager that executes commands based on the file extension of the edited file, as defined in a configuration file. It displays the command's output (stdout and stderr) in a menu, allowing navigation to error lines in the editor. Additionally, it supports file formatting with configurable tools.
